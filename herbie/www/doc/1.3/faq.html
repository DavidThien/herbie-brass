    <a href="../../">Herbie</a> automatically transforms floating point
    expressions into more accurate forms. This page catalogs questions
    frequently asked questions about Herbie.

  <h2>Troubleshooting common errors</h2>

  <p>
    Several Herbie error messages refer to this page for additional
    information and debugging tips.
  </p>

  <h3 id="invalid-syntax">Invalid syntax</h3>

  <p>
    This error means you mis-formatted Herbie's input. Common errors
    include misspelling function names and parenthesizing expressions
    that should not be parenthesized. For example, in
    <code>(- (exp (x)) 1)</code>, <code>(x)</code> is incorrect:
    <code>x</code> is a variable so shouldn't be
    parenthesized. <code>(- (exp x) 1)</code> would be the correct way
    of writing that expression. Please review
    the <a href="input.html">input format</a> documentation for more.
  </p>

  <h3 id="sample-valid-points">Cannot sample enough valid points</h3>

  <p>
    Herbie uses random sampling to select the points which it will use
    to evaluate the error of an expression. This error occurs when it
    is not able to find enough valid points. For example, consider the
    expression <code>(acos (+ 1000 x))</code>. This expression yields
    a valid result only when <code>x</code> is between -1001 and -999,
    a rather narrow range.
  </p>

  <p>
    The solution is to help out Herbie by specifying a precondition.
    Specify <code>:pre (&lt; -1001 x -999)</code> for the example
    above. Herbie will use the precondition to improve its sampling
    strategy.
  </p>

  <h3 id="no-valid-values">No valid values</h3>

  <p>
    This error indicates that your precondition excludes all possible
    inputs. For example, the precondition <code>(&lt 3 x 2)</code>
    excludes all inputs. Herbie raises this exception only when it can
    determine that no inputs work. The solution is to fix the
    precondition to allow some inputs. Note that sufficiently complex
    unsatisfiable preconditions instead raise the error above.
  </p>

  <h3 id="mpfr-prec-limit">Exceeded MPFR precision limit</h3>

  <p>
    Herbie computes "ground truth" results using
    <a href="http://www.mpfr.org/">MPFR</a>. For some expressions,
    like <code>(sin (exp x))</code>, using MPFR in this way requires
    exponentially many bits to compute a correct result. Herbie raises
    this error when more than 10,000 bits are required.
  </p>


  <h2>Understanding Common Warnings</h2>

  <p>Herbieâ€™s warnings refer to this page to describe the warning and
  common actions to take.</p>

  <h3 id="ground-truth">Could not determine a ground truth</h3>

  <p>
    Herbie will raise this warning when some inputs require more than
    10,000 bits to compute an exact ground truth value. This happens
    most often for expressions that divide two exponents,
    like <code>(/ (exp x) (exp x))</code> with very large inputs,
    where absurdly large exponents would be required to compute the
    accurate output. Herbie assumes that those points are invalid
    inputs and raises this warning to let you know about the issue. If
    you see this warning, you should add a restrictive precondition,
    such as <code>:pre (&lt; -100 x 100)</code>, to prevent large
    inputs.
  </p>

  <h3 id="native-ops">Native <var>operation</var> not supported on your system</h3>

  <p>
    Some systems do not have native implementations for all operations
    that Herbie uses. (For example, Microsoft's <code>math.h</code>
    does not provide the <code>y0</code> function.) Herbie provides a
    fallback implementation which is used by default for these
    functions. You can disable this fallback functionality
    with <code>--disable precision:fallback</code>.
  </p>


  <h2>Known bugs</h2>

  <p>Some bugs cannot be directly fixed and are documented here.</p>

  <h3>Missing reports chart on Chrome</h3>

  <p>
    When using Chrome to view web pages on your local machine, Chrome
    disables certain APIs for security reasons; this prevents the
    Herbie reports from drawing the chart. Run Chrome
    with <code>--allow-file-access-from-files</code> to fix this error.
