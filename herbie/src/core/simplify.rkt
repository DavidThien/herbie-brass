;;# One module to rule them all, the great simplify. This makes use of the other
;;# modules in this directory to simplify an expression as much as possible without
;;# making unecessary changes. We do this by creating an egraph, saturating it
;;# partially, then extracting the simplest expression from it.
;;#
;;# Simplify attempts to make only one strong guarantee:
;;# that the input is mathematically equivalent to the output; that is, for any
;;# exact x, evalutating the input on x will yield the same expression as evaluating
;;# the output on x.
